# Java Syntax Highlighter
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately performing syntax highlighting for Java source code. The model identifies and classifies syntactic elements such as classes, methods, variables, and constants, providing a visual aid to developers by enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Objective
The primary goal is to create an intelligent syntax highlighter that surpasses traditional rule-based systems by leveraging machine learning to understand context, scope, and the intricate relationships between code elements, offering a more dynamic and context-aware highlighting system.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
Source a large dataset of Java code from open-source platforms.
Ensure diversity in coding styles, domains, and complexity to create a robust model.

### Preprocessing
Utilize Java-specific parsers (e.g., ANTLR, Eclipse JDT) to analyze and label code elements.
Prepare the dataset by tokenizing the source code and tagging tokens with their corresponding syntactic roles.

### Feature Extraction
Employ advanced techniques to represent Java code numerically, focusing on maintaining syntactic and semantic information.
Explore embeddings and graph-based representations to capture the structural nature of programming languages.

## Model Development
Use a simple neural network for now to serve as the base model, but also test other models if time allows
Train the model to classify code elements accurately, optimizing for performance and generalization.

## Evaluation
Rigorously test the model using a separate validation set to assess its accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios.
Employ various metrics to determine model capability
