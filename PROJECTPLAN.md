# Data Collection
Gather a large dataset of source code files

# Preprocessing
Parse the source code to identify and label the syntactic elements like classes, variables, constants, functions, etc. 

# Feature Extraction
Convert code snippets into a suitable format for the model. This may involve tokenization, embedding (e.g., word2vec for code tokens), or other techniques to represent code in a numerical format.

# Model Selection
Choose a model architecture suited to sequence data and classification tasks.

# Training
Train the model on the preprocessed and labeled dataset, using a suitable loss function and optimizer to iteratively improve model performance in classifying code elements.

# Evaluation
Test the model on a separate validation set not seen during training to evaluate its performance in accurately identifying and classifying code elements.

# Optimization and Scaling
Refine the model by tuning hyperparameters, adding more data, or using advanced techniques to improve accuracy and reduce latency.
